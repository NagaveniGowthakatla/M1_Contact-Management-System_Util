#  CONTACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMl:
## Introduction:-
 A Contact Management System (most commonly know as a CRM or Customer Relationship Management) is a program that enables you to store and manage contact information. They are essentially databases that track all your information and communication based on your contacts.Many of these systems offer calendar integration which can be shared with your business contacts. This makes staying organised much easier and saves you the time it takes to manually maintain your contact database as well as liaising with clients to arrange your calendar. And this will work on your mobile so you can take it with you!A contact management application tracks your business contact information. It is a database for the communications you make daily, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. You can use a contact manager to easily organize and find all the information linked to business communications.In recruiting, you can use a contact management tool to keep track of candidate and client contact information. The application integrates all your contact information for different job orders.

## Objectives:-
The main purpose of contact management is to record and organize your contacts. Details within the software could include calls, tasks, job orders, and opportunities. All verbal and email communications can be documented in a CM system. This makes it easy to see who you’ve talked to and what you’ve talked about.Along with basic contacts, you can keep notes about your interactions within the software. This allows you to keep a full record of all your recruiting communications. Instead of losing data in stacks of paper or spreadsheets, all your information is in one, streamlined database.
